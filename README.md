#Back Button URL Generator#
**Version 1.0.1 (2014-05-12)**
=====================

This ExpressionEngine plugin generates a URL based on previous page. This is especially useful with ExpressionEngine's native pagination and/or people coming from external sources.

##Usage
	{exp:ehs_back_button url="" redirect=""}
	
##Parameters
	
- url - This will end up being the "needle"
- redirect - If the needle is not found, where should we send (can be relative with prepended "/")
